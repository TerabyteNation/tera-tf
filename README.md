Welcome Contributors!

This repo contains the code for TerabyteNation's website, which is written in the language of RUBY.

Design:
	Simplistic
	Mainly solid colors
Color Scheme:
	Blue 
	Purple
	Black - this might work, I think; maybe go for a dark metro-ish theme?
Pages and Sections:
	Server info (IP, bans, staff, donators, etc.)
	Donation page (Automatic donation bot add)
	Forums
	Scam/Shark/Other reports
	Other discussions
Competitive League info (roster, standings, schedule, etc.)
	(MAYBE) Matchup feature (Something slightly similar to tf2lobby, but only for teams that are signed up for the league to scrim other teams.) - this is the bit that I see the most work on.  to be perfectly honest, this would be difficult with pure php (lots of AJAX requests).
Trade listings
Price averages (calculated from listings, trade.tf, and backpack.tf)
