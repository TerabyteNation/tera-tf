    <h2>What is Tera.TF?</h2>
    <p>TeraGaming was created by TerabyteNation, and it's website is currently managed by
      <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/TerabyteNation">TerabyteNation</a>,
      <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/eqazec">eqazec</a>, and
      <a href="http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/redjazz96/">redjazz96</a>.</p>
    <p>Tera.TF aims to combine several aspects of Team Fortress 2 into one. We want to serve as a place where the community can interact with each other. To do this, we have created forums, user profiles, etc. We think that every member of the community should be able to show off their creations to other users, such as Source Filmmaker content. For this, we have created a section where people can share resources, projects, and even ideas they have created for Source Filmmaker. Since the Steam Workshop also performs similar functions, we have linked user profiles to their workshop pages so people can easily view items that community members have published to Steam. </p>
